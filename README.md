# Data-Analysis-Project-with-Python
## Project 1 - Weather Dataset

### Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python. 
#### The commands that we used in this project :

* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
* index - This attribute provides the index of the dataframe
* columns - It shows the name of each column
* dtypes - It shows the data-type of each column
* unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.
* nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
* count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
* info() - Provides basic information about the dataframe.

## Project 2 - Car Dataset

### Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python.
#### The commands that we used in this project : 

* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
* isnull() - It detect the missing values in the given series object.
* sum() - This function adds up all the numerical values in an iterable, such as a list, and returns the total of those values. 
* filla() - It replace the NAN value with certain number
* mean() - It give the average of given series
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
* isin() - This function is used to check each element in the DataFrame is contained in values or not.
* ~() - It uses remove the unwanted records.
* apply(lambda x : ) - We use the apply() function to apply the lambda function to both rows and columns of a dataframe.

## Project 3 - Police Dataset 

### Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python.
#### The commands that we used in this project : 

* isnull() - It detect the missing values in the given series object.
* sum() - This function adds up all the numerical values in an iterable, such as a list, and returns the total of those values. 
* drop() - Rows or columns can be removed using index label or column name using this method.
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
* groupby() -  It allows you to split your data into separate groups to perform computations for better analysis.
* map() -  map() is useful when you need to apply a transformation function to each item in an iterable and transform them into a new iterable. 
* mean() -  It give the average of given series
* describe() - The describe() method is used for calculating some statistical data like percentile, mean and std of the numerical values of the Series or DataFrame. 

## Project 4 - Covid-19 Dataset

### Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python.
#### The commands that we used in this project :

* isnull() - It detect the missing values in the given series object.
* sum() - This function adds up all the numerical values in an iterable, such as a list, and returns the total of those values. 
* count()- It calculates how many times a particular value appears within a string or a list 
* heatmap() - Plot rectangular data as a color-encoded matrix.
* groupby() -  It allows you to split your data into separate groups to perform computations for better analysis.
* sort_values () - It sorts a data frame in Ascending or Descending order of passed Column. 
* ~() - It uses remove the unwanted records.
